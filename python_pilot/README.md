Re_introduction and a refresher to python after a hiatus.
mini projects and basic exercises.


Overview of the Code
This Python code creates a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS) game where you play against the computer (called "Python" here). The game keeps track of scores, allows multiple rounds, and lets you quit when you're done. It's structured as a main function rps() that sets up the game, and an inner function play_rps() that handles each round and can call itself to play again (this is called recursion).
I'll explain it step by step, starting from the top. I'll break it into sections, describe what each part does, and explain key Python concepts for beginners. Assume you're new to Python‚ÄîI'll keep it simple!
Step 1: Importing Modules
import sys
import random
from enum import Enum
import sys: This brings in Python's "sys" module, which helps with system-related tasks. Here, it's used later to exit the program cleanly with sys.exit().
import random: This module lets the computer make random choices. It's used to pick the computer's move in the game (like flipping a coin but for rock, paper, or scissors).
from enum import Enum: Enums are like labeled lists of options that don't change. This imports the Enum class from the "enum" module. It's used to define the game's choices (rock=1, paper=2, scissors=3) in a neat, readable way.
Step 2: Defining the Main Function rps()
def rps():
    game_count = 0
    player_wins = 0
    python_wins = 0
def rps(): defines a function named rps (short for Rock-Paper-Scissors). Functions are like reusable blocks of code.
Inside, it sets up three variables (like scorekeepers):
game_count = 0: Tracks how many games (rounds) have been played.
player_wins = 0: Counts how many times you (the player) win.
python_wins = 0: Counts how many times the computer wins.
These are "local" variables (only exist inside this function), but they'll be updated in the inner function using a special keyword (nonlocal‚Äîexplained later).
Step 3: Defining the Inner Function play_rps()
This is nested inside rps(). It's where the actual game logic happens.
def play_rps():
        nonlocal player_wins
        nonlocal python_wins
def play_rps(): defines another function inside rps(). This inner function handles one round of the game.
nonlocal player_wins and nonlocal python_wins: The nonlocal keyword tells Python to use and modify the variables from the outer function (rps()). Without this, the inner function would treat them as new, separate variables. (Beginner tip: Think of nonlocal as saying "Hey, use the version from the parent function!")
Step 4: Defining the RPS Choices Using Enum
class RPS(Enum):
            ROCK = 1
            PAPER = 2
            SCISSORS = 3
This creates a class (like a blueprint) called RPS that inherits from Enum. It's a way to group related constants.
It defines three options: ROCK = 1, PAPER = 2, SCISSORS = 3 (note: "SCISSORS" is misspelled in the code‚Äîit should be "SCISSORS", but it still works).
Enums make code cleaner. Instead of using plain numbers, you can refer to RPS.ROCK, which is more readable.
Step 5: Getting the Player's Choice
playerChoice = input(
            "\nEnter ...\n1 for Rock,\n2 for paper,\n3 or scissors\n\n"
        )

        if playerChoice not in ["1", "2", "3"]:
            print("please choose 1, 2 or 3.")
            return play_rps()

        playa = int(playerChoice)
input(...): Asks the user (you) to type something. It shows a prompt like "Enter ... 1 for Rock, etc." and waits for your response.
It checks if your input (playerChoice) is not in the list ["1", "2", "3"]. If it's invalid (e.g., you type "4" or "apple"), it prints an error and calls play_rps() again (recursion‚Äîrestarting the function to try again).
If valid, playa = int(playerChoice): Converts your string input (like "1") to an integer (number) and stores it in playa. (Beginner tip: input() always gives a string, so int() turns it into a number for comparisons.)
Step 6: Getting the Computer's Choice
computerChoice = random.choice("123")

        computer = int(computerChoice)
random.choice("123"): Picks one character randomly from the string "123". So, it's like the computer randomly selecting 1, 2, or 3.
computer = int(computerChoice): Converts that character (e.g., "2") to an integer (2).
Step 7: Printing the Choices
print("\nyou chose " + str(RPS(playa)).replace("RPS.", " ") + ".")
        print("Pyhon3 chose " + str(RPS(computer)).replace("RPS.", " ") + ".\n")
This shows what you and the computer picked.
RPS(playa): Turns your number (e.g., 1) into the Enum value (e.g., RPS.ROCK).
str(RPS(playa)): Converts it to a string like "RPS.ROCK".
.replace("RPS.", " "): Replaces "RPS." with a space, so it becomes " ROCK" (note: there's a leading space, but it looks okay in output).
Same for the computer's choice. (Note: "Pyhon3" is a typo‚Äîit should be "Python", but it's just text.)
Step 8: Deciding the Winner
def decide_winner(playa, computer):
            nonlocal player_wins
            nonlocal python_wins
            if playa == 1 and computer == 3:
                player_wins += 1
                return "You win üéä üéâ"
            elif playa == 2 and computer == 1:
                player_wins += 1
                return "üéä üéâyou win"
            elif playa == 3 and computer == 2:
                player_wins += 1
                return "üéä üéâyou win"
            elif playa == computer:
                return "üôÉ Its a tie, Try Again!"
            else:
                python_wins += 1
                return "üêç Python wins!"
This defines a small inner function decide_winner that takes your choice and the computer's.
It uses if-elif-else to check win conditions:
Rock (1) beats Scissors (3).
Paper (2) beats Rock (1).
Scissors (3) beats Paper (2).
If choices match, it's a tie.
Otherwise, computer wins.
player_wins += 1: Adds 1 to your win count (same for computer).
Returns a fun message with emojis.
Again, nonlocal lets it update the outer scores.
Step 9: Running the Winner Function and Updating Game Count
game_result = decide_winner(playa, computer)

        print(game_result)

        nonlocal game_count
        game_count += 1
Calls decide_winner and stores the message in game_result.
Prints the result (e.g., "You win üéä üéâ").
nonlocal game_count: Uses the outer game_count.
game_count += 1: Increments the total games played.
Step 10: Printing Scores
print("\nGame count " + str(game_count))
        print("\nplayer wins " + str(player_wins))
        print("\npython wins " + str(python_wins))
Shows the current stats after each round. Converts numbers to strings with str() to print them.
Step 11: Asking to Play Again
print("\nplay again?")

        while True:
            playagain = input("\nY for Yes or \nQ to quit\n")
            if playagain.lower() not in ["y", "Q"]:
                continue
            else:
                break

        if playagain == "y":
            return play_rps()
        else:
            print("\nüéäüéâüéâ")
            print("Thank you for playing!\n")
            sys.exit("Bye üëã")
Prints "play again?" and asks for input: "Y for Yes or Q to quit".
while True:: An infinite loop that keeps asking until valid input.
playagain.lower(): Converts input to lowercase (e.g., "Y" becomes "y") for case-insensitive check.
If not "y" or "q", continue restarts the loop.
Otherwise, break exits the loop.
If "y", calls play_rps() again (recursion‚Äîstarts a new round).
If "q", prints a goodbye message and uses sys.exit("Bye üëã") to end the program.
Step 12: Returning and Starting the Game
return play_rps()
At the end of rps(), it returns the result of calling play_rps() (which starts the game loop).
Step 13: Running the Game
play = rps()

play()
play = rps(): Calls rps() and assigns its return value (which is the play_rps function) to play.
play(): Calls that function to start the first round.
How the Whole Thing Works
When you run the code, it starts the game loop.
You play rounds, scores update, and it asks if you want to continue.
It uses recursion (functions calling themselves) for new rounds instead of a loop, which works but can be risky if too many rounds (Python limits recursion depth).
Typos: There are a few (e.g., "SCISSORS", "Pyhon3", inconsistent capitalization in messages), but they don't break the code.
If you run this in a Python environment, it'll prompt you in the consol
